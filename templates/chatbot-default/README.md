## Project Setup Guide

This document outlines the steps to set up a new project using the project starter script.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (Optional, for containerization)
- [Prisma CLI](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/prisma-cli-reference)

## Installation

1.  **Run the starter script:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

    ```bash
    npx create-mts-chatbot <optional-project-name>
    ```

    - `<optional-project-name>` is an optional argument to give the project a name directly.

    **If you don't provide a project name in argument:** The script will prompt you to enter a project name.

    ```
    What is your project name?
    ```

2.  **Choose a package manager:**
    The script will prompt you to select a package manager:

    ```
    Choose a package manager
        > npm
        yarn
        pnpm
        bun
    ```

    Select your preferred package manager (`npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, or `bun`).

3.  **Select a template:**
    The script will list available templates. Choose the one that suits your needs:

    ```
    Select a template
        > Chatbot_with_Prisma ðŸ”¹ A chatbot template with Prisma integration
          ...
    ```

4.  **Project creation and dependency installation:**

    - The script will create a new directory with your project name and copy template files.
    - It will install the necessary Node.js dependencies using the selected package manager (npm/yarn/pnpm/bun).

5.  **Post-installation scripts:**

- Some templates might require additional steps, such as running `prisma generate` for the "Chatbot_with_Prisma" template.

6.  **Initialize Git:**

    - The script will automatically initialize a git repository within the project directory.

7.  **Completion message:**
    If all goes well, you'll see a "Complete setup project" message with additional instructions, if necessary, for the selected template.

## Usage (Example for Chatbot_with_Prisma template)

After setup for `Chatbot_with_Prisma` template, you'll see the message:

```
â›° Prisma installed. Check your .env settings and then run `npm run prisma:migrate`
```

1.  **Configure environment variables:**

    - Open the `.env` file in your project directory.
    - Update the settings to match your database configuration or desired settings.

2.  **Run database migrations (for Prisma templates):**
    For `Chatbot_with_Prisma` template, run the following command to apply database changes:

    ```bash
    npm run prisma:migrate
    ```

    If you use yarn, pnpm, or bun, use the `yarn run prisma:migrate`, `pnpm run prisma:migrate` or `bun run prisma:migrate` commands respectively.

3.  **Start your application:**
    Refer to the documentation of your selected template for the command to start the application (e.g., `npm run dev`).

## Troubleshooting

- **Package manager not installed:** If the script fails because your chosen package manager (`npm`,`yarn`,`pnpm` or `bun`) is not installed, you need to install it first.
- **Script errors:** If any errors happen during the process, copy the error message in your terminal and search the web or create an issue in this repo.
